# Bank Loan Data Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze U.S. bank loan data to uncover trends, assess loan quality, and evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for visualization. The insights gained from this analysis can help understand loan distribution, quality, and performance metrics, supporting decision-making processes in the banking sector.

## Tools Used

- **MS SQL Server**: For data preparation, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The project focuses on the following KPIs:

- **Total Loan Applications**: Number of loan applications submitted.
- **Total Funded Amounts**: Total value of loans funded by the bank.
- **Total Amount Received**: Total repayments received from borrowers.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Average interest rate across all loans.
- **Average Debt-to-Interest Ratio**: Ratio of debt to interest, reflecting borrower risk.

## Dashboards

The Tableau workbook includes three interactive dashboards:

1. **Loan Quality Overview**:
   - Compares "Good" vs. "Bad" loans.
   - Provides insights into loan performance and quality.

2. **Loan Distribution Analysis**:
   - Visualizes loan data with filters for state, month, employee length, purpose, and more.
   - Helps in understanding loan distribution across different dimensions.

3. **Key Metrics Summary**:
   - Displays a table of essential measures including total applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rates, and debt-to-interest ratios.
